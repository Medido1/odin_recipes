        <ol class="text">
          <li>Cut the hard boiled eggs in half, lengthwise.</li>
          <li>Gently pop out the yolks, using a spoon if necessary. 
            Place the yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl. Mash the yolks
            with the back of a fork until no large clumps remain.</li>
          <li>Add the mayo, mustard, pickle juice, and pepper to the bowl. 
            Mix and mash it together with the fork.</li>
          <li>ransfer the yolk mixture to a plastic food storage bag. 
            Squeeze out the air and seal the bag. Gently squeeze and 
            roll the bag around in your fingers until the yolk mixture 
            inside the bag is completely smooth. Work the yolk mixture 
            down to one corner of the bag. Use scissors to cut that corner 
            off of the bag.</li>
          <li>Gently squeeze the bag to pipe the yolk mixture into the hole of the egg whites.</li>
          <li>Serve cold. Store covered in the refrigerator. These are best if eaten within 2 days 
            but they will keep for 3 days.</li>
